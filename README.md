# nextjs-app-starter

An example of vramework specifically for a nextjs app.

This is based off a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).


To run:

```bash
npm run install
npm run prebuild
npm run start
```

## Backend code

You'll notice all the backend code lives inside the `backend` repo.

The `vramework-next.ts` file is generated by vramework and is specified within the `vramework.config.json` directory.
